# MMARKEX

Hello, <b>MMARKEX</b> is a tool that I coded in order to save some time or
just have fun. In the way I coded it, unfortunately some options are only
available in Debian-based distros, which, in my case, is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
I am planning to code it in a way multiple distros can support it.

If you use this tool, please give me some feedback, it will help to make it
better ;)
